# predictive-maintenance-ibm-cloud

A predictive maintenance system using IBM Cloud and Watson Studio to forecast machine failures.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project was built using IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI tool.

- Uploaded industrial machine sensor dataset
- Used AutoAI to automatically build and evaluate multiple machine learning pipelines
- Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy
- Deployed the model using IBM Watson Machine Learning
- Results, evaluation metrics, and screenshots are documented in the predictive-maintenance-report.pdf
